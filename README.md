# Hi there, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Cloud Native engineer and a mentor at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk).
I'm based in the beautiful county of [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire)
in the [English Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands).

I'm a comedy nerd who once got a thumbs up from [Barry Cryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Cryer).
I've also recorded at Abbey Road Studios and have a [number 9 chart hit with John
Otway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BwOyVIlupg&ab_channel=JohnOtway) (and 900
others). I keep bees, love being outside in my garden and enjoy tinkering in my
workshop.

I keep an [infrequent blog](https://www.simonemms.com/blog) where I talk all
things software engineering and developer culture.
